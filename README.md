# MySQL-Practice
This repository contains my MySQL practice work — including table creation, joins, subqueries, and real-world exercises. 

Welcome to my **MySQL Practice** repository — a collection of SQL scripts, database problems, and solutions I’ve worked on while learning and mastering SQL! 💻  

This repo is my personal **playground for database design, query optimization, and hands-on learning** — from simple `SELECT` queries to complex joins and subqueries.
